# Mini-Paint
This is a basic browser-based paint web application that allows users to create freehand drawings directly on a digital canvas. It's built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive interface for sketching, coloring, and editing artwork. Whether you're doodling for fun or prototyping a design idea, this tool offers essential drawing features:

✏️ Features:

    Pen Tool: Draw freely on the canvas using your mouse or touchscreen. The pen follows your cursor to create smooth strokes.

    Color Picker: Choose from a wide range of colors to draw with. You can change the pen color at any time.

    Eraser Tool: Erase parts of your drawing just like a real eraser. Switch between pen and eraser modes seamlessly.
